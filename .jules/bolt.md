## 2025-01-24 - [Date Gap Filling Optimization]
**Learning:** Filling date gaps in time-series results using nested loops (O(N*M)) is a common anti-pattern in this codebase. Using `array_column` to create an associative array (hash map) allows for O(N + M) performance, which is significantly better as the period or number of sales increases.
**Action:** Always look for nested loops over database results when generating reports or chart data and replace them with hash map lookups.
